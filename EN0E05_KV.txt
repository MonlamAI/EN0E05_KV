A Brief and Clear Manual for the Approach Retreat of Orange Mañjughoṣa Namo Mañjuśriye! To carry out the approach retreat for Orange Mañjughoṣa as a single deity, having first correctly received the corresponding authorization and pith instructions, retreat to an isolated and pleasant location, and clean it well. If you have a statue, a painting, or a relief sculpture of Mañjuśrī, position it facing you and place the offering torma in front of it. Observing the promised discipline, and maintaining cleanliness of body and purity of conduct, start the retreat at sunrise on an astrologically auspicious date. Engage in the practice at a rate of four sessions per day. You may perform a sādhana composed by the supreme founding masters of Sakya, or other reliable liturgies that contain the exact words of the founding masters, such as the sādhana written by Khedrub Palden Döndrub. Ideally, you should carry out an approach retreat based on signs, until signs of accomplishment are experienced. Second best is an approach retreat based on time, where you practice for a duration of six months. At the very least, you will engage in an approach retreat based on numbers, accumulating the mantra 800,000 times, including the supplementary recitations. As a fire offering is not explicitly mentioned, it is not necessary to perform it. During every session, at the end of the mantra recitation, recite the dhāraṇī that increases wisdom and intelligence: NAMO MAÑJUŚRIYE KUMĀRABHŪTĀYA | BODHISATVĀYA | MAHĀSATVĀYA | MAHĀKĀRUṆIKĀYA | TADYATHĀ | OṂ ARAJE | VIRAJE | ŚUDDHE VIŚUDDHE | ŚODHAYA VIŚODHAYA | AMALE | VIMALE | NIRMALE | JAYAVARE | RURU CALE | HŪṂ HŪṂ HŪṂ | PHAṬ PHAṬ PHAṬ SVĀHĀ Since Pagpa Rinpoche stated that one should recite this dhāraṇī as circumstances permit, recite it as much as possible, a hundred or at least twenty-one times. Offer the torma at the end of the second session or after the early morning session. Between sessions, diligently recite praises to Mañjuśrī, such as Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī, and make maṇḍala offerings. When you experience signs of obstacles, protect yourself through the meditation and mantra recitation of Acala. By diligently practicing in this way, you will initially give rise to retentive memory, and gradually the power of your intelligence will reach perfection in prosody and other fields of knowledge. This is certain. This was written by Mañjughoṣa. May it be virtuous.
